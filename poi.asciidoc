1. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general terms, a "point of interest" is a location about which
information is available. A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates
and an identifier, or more complex such as a three dimensional model of
a building with names in various languages, information about open and
closed hours, and a civic address. POI data has many uses including
navigation systems, mapping, geocaching, location-based social
networking games, and augmented reality browsers.

POI data has traditionally been exchanged in proprietary formats by
various transport mechanisms. This specification defines a flexible,
lightweight, extensible POI data model, and one normative syntax for the
data model. This will enable content publishers to effectively describe
and efficiently serve and exchange POI data.

To achieve these goals, this document describes a generic data model and
one normative format. This format is based on XML and is likely
insufficient to cover all possible POI use cases, therefore, the format
is extensible, and it is expected that the data model will be mapped to
other formats, such as JSON, GML, RDF, GeoRSS, or HTML.

2. Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The key words "_must_", "_must not_", "_required_", "_shall_", "_shall
not_", "_should_", "_should not_", "_recommended_", "_may_", and
"_optional_" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[link:#bib-RFC2119[RFC2119]].

[[]]
3. Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Location::
  The term location is used to refer to an identifiable geographic place
  [link:#bib-ISO19112[ISO19112]]. Typically a location is a physically
  fixed point, typically on the surface of the Earth, though locations
  can be relative to other, non-earth centric coordinate reference
  systems. Locations can be a single point, a centroid, a minimum
  bounding rectangle, or a set of vectors. A location should be
  persistent over time and does not change. Multiple POIs _may_ share
  the same location. When a POI physically moves it is understood to
  have acquired a new location.
Points of Interest::
  Unlike the term location, the term POI is a human construct. POIs
  typically describe a location where one can find a place, product or
  service, typically identified by name rather than by address and
  characterized by type, which _may_ be used as a reference point or a
  target in a location based service request, e.g., as the destination
  of a route. For the purposes of this document, the term POI does not
  exclude the labeling, identification, and tracking of persons and
  other physical objects that have no permanent location.
Places::
  A place is also a human construct which typically has a coarse level
  of spatial granularity. Places are generally larger scale
  administrative constructs, either informally or formally defined.
  Countries, states, counties, districts, neighborhoods and postal codes
  or telephone area codes are all places. Places are also informally or
  colloquially defined, such as the Home Counties in the United Kingdom
  and the Bay Area in the United States.
  +
  Places have spatial relationships; with parents, children, adjacencies
  and contained by semantics. Places have the same attribute set as
  POIs, although often with differing interpretations based on scale;
  for example, the address of a Place or its URI might refer to the
  address of the administrative or governing body of the place.
  +
  A place typically contains multiple POIs and can also be coterminous
  with a POI. In the former case, a place, such as a city or a
  neighborhood, will contain multiple POIs. In the latter case, a place
  and a POI will occupy the same position and extent, such as in the
  case of Yellowstone National Park, which is both a Place and a POI.
  For the purposes of this document no distinction will be made between
  a place and a POI.
Coordinate::
  The term coordinate refers to one of a sequence of n numbers
  designating the position of a point in n-dimensional space
  [link:#bib-ISO19111[ISO19111]].
Coordinate Reference System::
  The term coordinate reference system refers to a coordinate system
  that is related to an object by a datum
  [link:#bib-ISO19111[ISO19111]].
Coordinate System::
  The term coordinate system refers to a set of mathematical rules for
  specifying how coordinates are to be assigned to points
  [link:#bib-ISO19111[ISO19111]].
Datum::
  The term datum refers to a parameter or set of parameters that define
  the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of a
  coordinate system [link:#bib-ISO19111[ISO19111]].
Geolocation::
  The term geolocation refers to the identification of the real world
  geographic location of an object.
Point::
  The term point refers to a 0-dimensional geometric primitive,
  representing a position [link:#bib-ISO19107[ISO19107]].
Position::
  The term position refers to a data type that describes a point or
  geometry potentially occupied by an object or person
  [link:#bib-ISO19133[ISO19133]].
Route::
  The term route refers to a sequence of links and / or partial links
  that describe a path, usually between two positions, within a network
  [link:#bib-ISO19133[ISO19133]].
Coordinate Set::
  The term coordinate set refers to the individual parts of a
  coordinate. This is often a simple coordinate pair of latitude and
  longitude values, but based on the coordinate system used, _may_ be
  other values, see link:#CRS[section 4.6.1.1 Coordinate Reference
  Systems].

4. POI Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Point of Interest data model consists of a POI entity and a POIS
grouping entity. Each POI has a number of properties for capturing
descriptive information along with a Location entity describing its
location. In order to maximize the flexibility with which POI, POIS and
their sub-entities can be described, each inherits its properties from a
single common entity. In practical terms, this allows properties such as
update time, authorship, links and other categorizations to be described
at multiple levels of granularity within the data model.

More formally, the core data model consists of the POIType entity
derived and having child entities derived from an abstract POIBaseType
entity. This common POIBaseType allows the authorship, modification, and
source of POIs to be attributed at the POI level, at the child entity
level, and at a group level through the POIS grouping entity. Child
entities are constructed from primtive datatypes, POIBaseType entities
or POITermType entities having the additional properties:

1.  *term:* a machine readable character string to designate any number
of discrete choices
2.  *scheme:* a URL pointing to the schema enumurating the discrete
choices in term

Both the POI and POIS entity can contain any number of the following
child entities:

1.  *label:* a human readable label for the POI that can be
discriminated with a term property (e.g. primary, collogiual, etc.).
2.  *description:* a human readable description of the POI that can be
discrimintated with a language property.
3.  *category:* like all things, there are many ways to categorize a
POI. It could have a primary use, such as restaurant or museum; it could
have a popularity rating; it could have a security classification.
4.  *time:* a POI exists within a certain context. Time is one of those
contexts. The POI _may_ have a known time when it came into being, and
can therefore have a start date. The POI might no longer exist at a
known point in time (in the future or in the past), and will therefore
have an end date. There can be even more complex cases, where a POI
exists on a regularly scheduled sequence of times. This specification
handles that case also by allowing one to specify the time period using
the iCalendar standard [link:#bib-RFC5545[RFC5545]].
5.  *link:* adopted from the Atom link object
[link:#bib-RFC4087[RFC4087]], a link is a generic way to define a
relationship from a POI to another POI, or from a POI to any other web
resource.
6.  *metadata:*this is the place to attach formal metadata to the POI
via reference or inline. It is anticipated that some people will use
this for Dublin Core or ISO 19115 metadata.

The POI entity _must_ contain a single Location entity having at least
one Undertermined entity, and Address entity or a geometry entity
containing a GML_CE_Geometry entity.

diagram of POI core data model]

The entities of the core data model are described in more detail below.

[[]]
4.1 POIBaseType
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

POIBaseType is the common entity from which the majority of POI entities
are derived. It provides properties related to id, source, authorship,
licensing, and modification times for creation, deletion and updating.
This base type allows the POI entity, POIS grouping entity and most
child entities to carry distinct information about their provinence,
source and history.

[[properties]]
Properties

[cols="<,<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Count |Details |Type
|id |[0..1] |A unique identifier for this location. Can be a URI
fragment. Refer to xml:base [link:#bib-XMLBASE[XMLBASE]] for more info
|string

|href |[0..1] |An absolute reference to the POI content |URI

|value |[0..1] |The POI information content |CDATA

|base |[0..1] |XML base when id is not absolute. Refer to xml:base
[link:#bib-XMLBASE[XMLBASE]] for more info |URI

|type |[0..1] |MIME type [RFC2046] |string

|lang |[0..1] |XML Language type [RFC3066] |string

|updated |[0..1] |Time this POI information was last changed
[link:#bib-ISO8601[ISO8601]] also refer to atom:updated
[link:#bib-RFC4087[RFC4087]] |dateTime

|created |[0..1] |Time at which this POI information was created
|dateTime

|deleted |[0..1] |Time at which this POI information was deleted
|dateTime

|author |[0..1] |Author of this POI information see
link:#author-entity[section 4.2.1 author] |location

|license |[0..1] |License restrictions on this POI information see
link:#license-entity[section 4.2.2 license] |category
|=======================================================================

The id property is highly _recommended_. Using a unique URL or a
resolvable combination of id and base URI is also _recommended_.

The href property _may_ serve as an absolute reference to retrieve the
POI information when the id and base do not combine to form a resolvable
URL.

The value property is the _recommended_ location for arbitrary strings
(e.g. label, description, etc.). Many entities derived from POIBaseType
may not require this property (e.g. link, license, geometry entities).

The updated, created and deleted pro perties are for capturing the
modification history of the POI information itself. Any information
about the existence of the POI itself as a human concept should use the
POIType time entity described below.

[[]]
4.2 POITermType
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The POITermType entity is an abstract entity derived from POIBaseType
and adds properties for the management of categorical descriptions. The
category, link, label, author, license and time entities in addition to
the geometry elements point, line and polygon entities are all instances
of POITermType.

[[properties-1]]
Properties

[cols="<,<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Count |Details |Type
|term |[0..1] |A machine-readable character string to designate any
number of discrete choices |URI

|scheme |[0..1] |An absolute reference to the schema enumurating the
dicrete choices in term |URI
|=======================================================================

It is _recommended_ to utilize the value property inherited from
POIBaseType when describing human readable categorical descriptions.

[[]]
4.2.1 author
++++++++++++

The author entity is of type POITermType and specifies a single author.
The value property specifies the actual author and is determined by the
type property (MIME type). When the mime type property is undetermined
or text/plain the content of the value property is assumed to be free
text. When the mime type property is text/vcard the value content is
expected in VCard format [link:#bib-RFC6350[RFC6350]].

[[some-recommented-terms]]
Some Recommented Terms

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|==================================
|Name |Details
|primary |Primary author
|secondary |Secondary author
|contributer |A contributing author
|editor |Editor
|publisher |Publisher
|==================================

Multiple authors can be specified by nesting author properties, and
their authorship role _may_ be discriminated with the term property
(e.g. primary, publisher, editor, etc.).

[[]]
4.2.2 license
+++++++++++++

The license entity is of type POITermType and specifies a single
license. The language the license is in _may_ be indicated using the
lang property. Multiple licenses _may_ be discriminated with the term
property (e.g. common, opensource, etc.). The first license encountered
per language is considered the primary license for that language.

[[]]
4.3 POIType
^^^^^^^^^^^

The POIType entity is an abstract entity derived from POIBaseType and
adds entities for describing, labeling, categorizing and indicating the
time span of a POI or group of POIs. The entity also incudes child
entities for linking to other POIs, external web resources or metadata.

[[contains]]

[cols="<,<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Count |Details |Type

synonyms and multiple languages |POITermType

|description |[0..*] |A human-readable description that can be
discrimintated with the language attribute |POIBaseType

|category |[0..*] |A categorical classification of the POI. |POITermType

|time |[0..*] |A fixed time or sequence of times using iCalendar when
the mime type is text/calendar |POITermType

|link |[0..*] |A link to another POI or web resource. |POITermType

|metadata |[0..1] |see link:#metadata-entity[section 4.3.6 metadata]
|Metadata
|=======================================================================

[[]]
4.3.1 label
+++++++++++

The label entity is of type POITermType and specifies any number of
human readable labels. The language of label _may_ be indicated using
the lang property. Multiple labels _may_ be discriminated with the term
property (e.g. primary, colloquial, etc.). The first label encountered
per language is considered the primary label for that language.

It is _recommended_ to use the term property to discriminate between
different categories of label entities.

[[some-recommented-terms-1]]

[[]]
4.3.2 description
+++++++++++++++++

The label entity is of type POITermType and specifies any number of
human readable descriptions. The language the description is in _may_ be
indicated using the lang property. The first description encountered per
language is considered the primary description for that language.

[[]]
4.3.3 category
++++++++++++++

The category entity is of type POITermType and makes associations with
any number of categories. Category is adopted from the atom:category
object [link:#bib-RFC4087[RFC4087]], and works in much the same way. A
category should specify the type of POI, such as city, restaurant, etc.
Multiple categories are allowed to accommodate the fact that POIs may be
more than one thing. For example, a casino might be a gambling hall, a
restaurant, and a concert venue. A grocery store may also be a bank and
a pharmacy.

The category property classifies the POI using keywords. The category's
value property is the keyword, or tag. The term is the classification
scheme to which the value belongs. To emulate a "folksonomy" or "free
tagging", the term should be "free". This tagging system _may_ be more
formally structured using the scheme property to specify a dictionary of
terms or a web resource containing definitions of the terms and values.
The href property _may_ be used to provide a resolvable link to a more
comprehensive definition of the category.

[[]]
4.3.4 time
++++++++++

The time entity is of type POITermType and specifies any number of times
applicable to a POIType entity (i.e. an individual point in time, a span
of time, or a recurring time or time span).

A POI exists within a certain context. Time is one of those contexts.
The POI may have a known time when it came into being, and can therefore
have a start date. The POI might no longer exist at a known point in
time (in the future or in the past), and will therefore have an end
date. There can be even more complex cases, where a POI exists on a
regularly scheduled sequence of times. The data model handles that case
by allowing one to specify the time period using the iCalendar standard
[link:#bib-RFC5545[RFC5545]].

It is _recommended_ to use the term property to discriminate between
different time entity categories.

[[some-recommended-terms]]
Some Recommended Terms

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=============================================
|Name |Details
|start |Time when the POI came into being
|end |Time when the POI ceased to exist
|instant |A single time when an event happened
|open |A recuring time when a POI is open
|=============================================

When the mime type attribute is undetermined or text/plain the content
of the value property is assumed to be in the dateTime format
[link:#bib-ISO8601[ISO8601]]. When the mime type attribute is
text/calendar the value content is expected in iCalendar format.

[[]]
4.3.5 link
++++++++++

The link entity is of type POITermType and adopted from the atom:link
object [link:#bib-RFC4087[RFC4087]] which works in the same way. A link
is a generic way to define a relationship between the POI and other
Web-accessible resources. Links are a powerful way to describe a host of
relationships. One could argue that just as Web pages obtain most of
their value by the links between them, a POI's value is directly related
to the number of links between it and others. Links in POIs are perhaps
even more important than links in Web pages or Atom feeds, as POIs are
inherently place-based objects with natural relationships in space and
time that should be expressed. Those spatial relationships are mostly
covered by the Relationship primitive described below, which is in many
ways a specialization of the generic Link. But there are many more
semi-spatial and non-spatial relationships that can be expressed using
Link.

This specification proposes a number of best practices for defining
links. Key relations from the IANA registry are listed below in italics.
Those relations in bold are defined only in this specification.

[[relations]]
Relations

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Details
|_alternate_ |a identical POI. Often used as a permalink

|_canonical_ |the preferred version of a set of POIs with highly similar
content. For example, there could be many different perceptions of a
neighborhood boundary POI, but the city's neighborhood map could be the
canonical version of this POI.

|_copyright_ |a copyright statement that applys to the link's context

|_describedby_ |more information about this POI

|_edit_ |a resource that can be used to edit the POI's context

|_enclosure_ |a related resource that is potentially large and might
require special handling

|_icon_ |[multiblock cell omitted]

|_latest-version_ |points to a resource containing the latest version

|_license_ |a license for this POI

|_related_ |a related resource

|search |a resource that can be used to search through the link's
context and related resources

|*parent* |a parent POI, often the enclosing geographic entity, or the
entity this POI in under the domain of (such as a field office-corporate
headquarters relationship)

|*child* |a child POI, often a geography entity enclosed or under the
domain of this POI

|*historic* |links to a POI or other web resource that describes this
place at a previous point in time

|*future* |links to a POI or other web resource that describes this
place at a later point in time

4.3.6 metadata
++++++++++++++

Dublin Core or [link:#bib-ISO19115[ISO19115]] metadata.

There is a WG question on whether this adequately addresses concerns
about extensibility. See
http://www.w3.org/2010/POI/track/issues/18[ISSUE-18].

[[]]
4.4 POIS
^^^^^^^^

The POIS entity is of type POIType and can have one or more children
entities of type POI.

[[]]
4.5 POI
^^^^^^^

The POI entity is of type POIType and adds the Location entity for
describing the location of the POI.

[[]]
4.6 Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Location entity is of type POIBaseType and provides a flexible
description of the location of a POI. A Location can be represented in a
variety of ways, such as the geodetic coordinates for the center of the
POI, civic address, line, bounding box, polygon, or undetermined. A
location is a _required_ part of a POI and has child entities describing
geometry, address or the undetermined entity.

[[contains-1]]

|=======================================================================

If a Location neither includes a geometry entity nor an address entity
then it _must_ include the undetermined entity.

Do we want to allow no child elements to indicate that dynamic data
should be retrieved using the href property?

[[]]
4.6.1 GML_CE_Geometry
+++++++++++++++++++++

The GML_CE_Geometry is the base entity from which all geometry entities
are derived. It combines a coordinate system description with a set of
coordinates.

[[]]
4.6.1.1 Coordinate Reference Systems

In all of the entities that specify geodetic coordinates, an srsName
property is included in order to indicate the coordinate reference
system (CRS) being used. The srsName value is a URI
[link:#bib-RFC3986[RFC3986]] indicating the CRS used and is
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326 by default. This default is
the URI for the World Geodetic System 84 (WGS84) in 2 dimensions,
latitude and longitude. Other CRS URNs are allowed. In particular, the
URI http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4979 indicates WGS84 in 3
dimensions, latitude, longitude and elevation in meters above sea level.
The CRS used influences the interpretation of the coordinate set.

The default CRS refers to WGS84 geographic longitude and latitude
expressed in decimal degrees, namely EPSG 4326, without the degrees
symbol, "°". The values of latitude and longitude are bounded by ±90°
and ±180° respectively. Positive latitudes are north of the equator,
negative latitudes are south of the equator. Positive longitudes are
east of the Prime Meridian, negative longitudes are west of the Prime
Meridian. Latitude and longitude are expressed in that sequence, namely
latitude before longitude.

Implementations are required to support the following CRS based on WGS
84 NIMA.TR8350.2-3e [link:#bib-NIMA-TR8350-2[NIMA-TR8350-2]]. These are
identified using the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) Geodetic
Parameter Dataset, as formalized by the Open Geospatial Consortium
(OGC):

• http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326: 2 dimensional WGS 84,
latitude, and longitude +
 • http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4979: 3 dimensional WGS 84,
latitude, longitude, altitude

The most recent version of the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset should be
used. A CRS must be specified using the above URI notation only,
implementations do not need to support user-defined CRSs.

Are CRSes going to always be identified by URNs? There's discussion on
the confusion in
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/geopriv/current/msg00941.html[this
thread]. Raj mentioned OGC may be moving to URIs. The URN namespace ID
ogc is http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5165[registered] with IANA.  +
 Need a link to where OGC formalized this stuff.  +
 Need reference for EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset, found
http://www.epsg.org/Geodetic.html[this], but it seems to imply you need
.NET to get updates, is this the right place?

This specification does not assign responsibilities for coordinate
transformations from and to other Coordinate Reference Systems.

*Note:* The term coordinate set as used throughout this document refers
to coordinates as influenced by the rules laid out above

[[]]
4.6.2 Point
+++++++++++

The Point entity is derived from POITermType and adds a single Point
entity of type GML_CE_Geometry. It describes a single coordinate set,
the interpretation of which is influenced by the CRS attribute.

Some Recommented Terms

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|==========================================
|Name |Details
|center |The centroid of the Location
|navigation point |Generic navigation point
|entrance |Navigation poin to the entrance
|==========================================

The Point entity locates the centroid of the POI and is the most common
way of specifying a location. For most places, such as cities,
businesses, tourist sites, or events, a center location can be useful
for many types of software applications where additional detail is
unnecessary, such as driving directions or computing rough distances.
Therefore, even if the POI is also specified with a polygon or a line,
it is good practice to include a center point.

[[]]
4.6.3 Line
++++++++++

The Line entity is derived from POITermType and adds a single LineString
entity of type GML_CE_Geometry. It describes a list of two or more
coordinate sets, the interpretation of which is influenced by the CRS
attribute.

[[contains-3]]
Contains

[cols="<,<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Count |Details |Type
|LineString |1 |A coordinate set defined in a particular CRS
|GML_CE_Geometry
|=======================================================================

A Line entity can be used to describe a linear feature, such as a road,
a bike route, a river, etc.

[[]]
4.6.4 Polygon
+++++++++++++

The Polygon entity is derived from POITermType and adds a single
SimplePolygon entity of type GML_CE_Geometry. It describes a list of
three or more coordinate sets, the interpretation of which is influenced
by the CRS attribute. The last coordinate does not have to repeat the
first coordinate in this simplified encoding, so only three control
points are _required_ to specify a simple polygon.

[[contains-4]]
Contains

[cols="<,<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Count |Details |Type
|SimplePolygon |1 |A coordinate set defined in a particular CRS
|GML_CE_Geometry
|=======================================================================

A Polygon entity describes the boundary of something. There is a WG
question on whether we should support more complex topology than a
simple polgyon, e.g. should we support holes? See
http://www.w3.org/2010/POI/track/issues/43[ISSUE-43].

[[]]
4.6.5 Address
+++++++++++++

The Address entity is of type POIBaseType and describes a civic address
such as a mailing address or a street address. It's value is determined
by the type property, and should be either vCard (text/directory) or
free text (text/plain).

The data model and descriptions are inconsistent. Need to determine
whether multiple addresses are allowed.

[[]]
4.6.6 Undertermined
+++++++++++++++++++

An Undetermined entity represents a location that is as of yet
undetermined. This can be used to describe a POI prior to the final
location being resolved. The Undetermined entity has no properties.

[[]]
4.6.7 Relationship
++++++++++++++++++

This section is getting some expansion from OGC

The Relationship entity is derived from POITermType and establishes
1-to-1 or 1-to-many relationships between POIs. Each Relationship entity
_must_ be assigned one of 8 term properties that describe the
geo-spatial relationship to the POI indicated by the targetPOI property.

[link:#bib-ISO13249-3[ISO13249-3]] (SQL/MM Spatial) supports the general
purpose relates operator from [link:#bib-ISO19107[ISO19107]], which
tests if two geometries (a and b) are related by testing the dimension
of the intersections of their boundaries, interiors and exteriors.
Points have a dimension of zero, curves one and surfaces two.

SQL/MM also supports the 19107 operator equals, which tests if two
geometries are spatially equal. More formally, their symmetric
difference _must_ be empty. SQL/MM then adds seven semantic operators to
test the relationship between geometries a and b. These relationships
are expressed in terms of the boundary, interior and exterior
intersections to avoid ambiguities.

[[required-terms]]
Required Terms

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Details
|equals |A equals B tests if the geometries are spatially equal. More
formally, their symmetric difference _must_ be empty. The test for
equivalence may be limited to the resolution of the coordinate system or
the accuracy of the data.

|disjoint |A disjoint B tests if A and B have NO points in common.

|intersects |A intersects B tests if A and B have ANY points in common.

|crosses |A crosses B if their interiors intersect with a dimension less
that the larger of the dimension of A or B and the intersection of the
interior of a with the exterior of B is not null (so for two lines, the
intersection has to be at a finite number of points). Surfaces cannot
cross anything. Points cannot be crossed by anything.

|overlaps |A overlaps B tests if part of their respective interiors
intersect, and if this intersection is the same dimension as the
interiors of the original geometries. (This last bit rules out crosses).
Some of their interior _must_ intersect with the exterior of the other
one and vice versa (i.e., one cannot be within the other). This bit
rules out within and contains. Overlap only applies if the two
geometries are of the same dimension.

|within |A within B if their intersection equals A. e.g. a POI
describing a store may state that it is contained within a shopping
mall.

|contains |A contains B is equivalent to B within A. e.g. a POI
describing a mall may state that it contains POIs for each store that is
within the mall.

|touches |A touches B means one's boundary intersects with the other's
interior or boundary. Interiors cannot intersect. Points cannot touch.
e.g. a POI representing a store within a mall may state that it is next
door to another POI which represents the store next door.

5.18 `<point>` element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any number of individual points. The <point> element _must_ contain one
<Point> element.

The <point> element includes those attributes in the POITermType common
attributes set. Refer to POITermType common attributes for a list of
those attributes. Implementors may consider using an abstract base class
when implementing this element.

It is _recommended_ to use the term property to discriminate between
different categories of <point> elements.

|Name |Details
|equals |A equals B tests if the geometries are spatially equal. More
formally, their symmetric difference _must_ be empty.

|disjoint |A disjoint B tests if A and B have NO points in common.

|intersects |A intersects B tests if A and B have ANY points in common.

|crosses |A crosses B if their interiors intersect with a dimension less
that the larger of the dimension of A or B and the intersection of the
interior of a with the exterior of B is not null.

|overlaps |A overlaps B tests if part of their respective interiors
intersect, and if this intersection is the same dimension as the
interiors of the original geometries.

|within |A within B if their intersection equals A. e.g. a POI
describing a store may state that it is contained within a shopping
mall.

|contains |A contains B is equivalent to B within A. e.g. a POI
describing a mall may state that it contains POIs for each store that is
within the mall.

|touches |A touches B means one's boundary intersects with the other's
interior or boundary.
