=== Crossrail Use Case

Crossrail is delivering the Elizabeth line, a 118km railway that will link Reading and Heathrow in the west with Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east via 21km of twin-bored tunnels under London.

This involves digging large tunnels under a city honycombed with current and abandoned subterranian infrastructure. "Tunnelling so close to existing train tunnels and utilities with no impact on daily operations was a challenge. At Tottenham Court Road we were sitting just 800mm over the Northern line platforms in a 900 tonne tunnelling machine and no one was any the wiser."
