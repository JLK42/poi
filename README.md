About Points of Interest (POI) Repository
===

This repository contains files about and for the purpose of developing one or more POI specifications following the Open Geospatial Consortium processes and policies.

The repo contains files from three sources:

*All contents of this repo beginning from when it was created by the transfer of work from the W3C to end of 2014 when the activity of the POW SWG stopped
link:http://github.com/opengeospatial/templates[OGC Templates] (origin of the SWG charter.adoc)
link:http://github.com/metanorma/ogc-wfs/tree/afad7f2cfca77ba67c5b82dee68124dd077b9b4f[Metanorma OGC Web Feature Service 3.0 specification repository]

In order to serve as a template for the POI standard to be developed and maintained in compliance with the Metanorma tools and workflow, the draft Metanorma OGC WFS 3.0 specification files were added to the repo after being modified extensively.
