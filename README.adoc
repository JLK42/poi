# About OGC Points of Interest (PoI) GitHub Repository

This repository contains files about and for the purpose of developing one or more PoI specifications following the Open Geospatial Consortium processes and policies.

The repo contains files from the following sources:

1. All contents of this repo beginning from when it was created by the transfer of work from the W3C to end of 2014 when the activity of the POI SWG stopped. These files were moved into a https://github.com/opengeospatial/poi/tree/main/POI-repo-files-Pre-2014[dedicated folder] in order to preserve the prior work of the OGC POI SWG. At the same time as the files were put into their folder on this repo, all the issues created prior to the end of 2014 are labelled and closed.

2. https://github.com/opengeospatial/templates[OGC Templates GitHub Repository]
This is the origin of one file at the top level of this repo, the https://github.com/opengeospatial/poi/blob/main/Draft_PoI_SWG_charter.adoc[Draft PoI SWG charter template]

3. https://github.com/metanorma/ogc-wfs/tree/afad7f2cfca77ba67c5b82dee68124dd077b9b4f[Metanorma OGC Web Feature Service 3.0 Specification Repository]
In order to serve as a template for the PoI standard(s) to be developed and maintained in compliance with the Metanorma tools and workflow, the draft Metanorma OGC WFS 3.0 specification files were added to the repo after being modified extensively (e.g., global replacement of WFS with "POI"). There remain files and sections of text which refer to WFS 3.0 which, as the draft PoI specification develops, will be removed and replaced with text pertaining to POI.
