# POI Use Cases

## Content

This folder contains both developmental and accepted use cases for the POI Use Case document.

## Building Use Cases

To produce new use cases:

* Create a subdirectory using the name of your use case
* Copy the `POI_Use_Case_Template.adoc` file into the subdirectory
* Copy the `POI_Use_Case_Details_Template.adoc` file into the subdirectory
* Change your current directory to the subdirectory
* Rename `POI_Use_Case_Template.adoc` to `use_case_<use case name>.adoc`. Do not use any spaces in the file name.
* Rename `POI_Use_Case_Details_Template.adoc` to `use_case_details_<use case name>.adoc`. Do not use any spaces in the file name.
* Populate the use case details file with a description of your use case.
* Populate the sections of the use case file with information about your use case.
* Refine the content of both files until they are done.

Use cases which are completed and accepted will be imported by the `clause_7_use_cases.adoc` file.
